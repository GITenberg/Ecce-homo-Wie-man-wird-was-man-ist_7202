description: "Ecce Homo: How One Becomes What One Is (German: Ecce homo: Wie man wird,\
  \ was man ist) is the last original book written by philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche\
  \ before his final years of insanity that lasted until his death in 1900. It was\
  \ written in 1888 and was not published until 1908.\nAccording to one of Nietzsche's\
  \ most prominent English translators, Walter Kaufmann, the book offers \"Nietzsche's\
  \ own interpretation of his development, his works, and his significance.\" The\
  \ book contains several chapters with ironic self-laudatory titles, such as \"Why\
  \ I Am So Wise\", \"Why I Am So Clever\", \"Why I Write Such Good Books\" and \"\
  Why I Am a Destiny\". Walter Kaufmann, in his biography Nietzsche: Philosopher,\
  \ Psychologist, Antichrist noticed the internal parallels, in form and language,\
  \ to Plato's \"Apology\" which documented the Trial of Socrates. In effect, Nietzsche\
  \ was putting himself on trial with this work, and his sardonic judgments and chapter\
  \ headings are mordant, mocking, self-deprecating, sly, and they turn this trial\
  \ against his future accusers, distorters, and superficial judges.\n\nWithin this\
  \ work, Nietzsche is self-consciously striving to present a new image of the philosopher\
  \ and of himself, for example, a philosopher \"who is not an Alexandrian academic\
  \ nor an Apollonian sage, but Dionysian.\" On these grounds, Kaufmann considers\
  \ Ecce Homo a literary work comparable in its artistry to Vincent van Gogh's paintings.\
  \ Just as Socrates was presented in Plato's Apology as the wisest of men precisely\
  \ because he freely admitted to his own ignorance, Nietzsche argues that he himself\
  \ is a great philosopher because of his withering assessment of the pious fraud\
  \ of the entirety of Philosophy which he considered as a retreat from honesty when\
  \ most necessary, and a cowardly failure to pursue its stated aim to its reasonable\
  \ end. Nietzsche insists that his suffering is not noble but the expected result\
  \ of hard inquiry into the deepest recesses of human self-deception, and that by\
  \ overcoming one's agonies a person achieves more than any relaxation or accommodation\
  \ to intellectual difficulties or literal threats. He proclaims the ultimate value\
  \ of everything that has happened to him (including his father's early death and\
  \ his near-blindness – an example of love of Fate or amor fati). In this regard,\
  \ the wording of his title was not meant to draw parallels with Jesus, but suggest\
  \ a contrast, that Nietzsche truly is \"a man.\" Nietzsche's point is that to be\
  \ \"a man\" alone is to be more than \"a Christ\".\nOne of the main purposes of\
  \ Ecce Homo was to offer Nietzsche's own perspective on his work as a philosopher\
  \ and human being. He wrote: \"Under these circumstances I have a duty against which\
  \ my habits, even more the pride of my instincts, revolt at bottom – namely, to\
  \ say: Hear me! For I am such and such a person. Above all, do not mistake me for\
  \ someone else!\" Throughout the course of the book, he expounds — in the characteristically\
  \ hyperbolic style found in his later period (1886–1888) — upon his life as a child,\
  \ his tastes as an individual, and his vision for humanity. He gives reviews and\
  \ insights about his various works, including: The Birth of Tragedy, The Untimely\
  \ Meditations, Human, All Too Human, The Dawn, The Gay Science, Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\
  \ Beyond Good and Evil, On the Genealogy of Morality, Twilight of the Idols and\
  \ The Case of Wagner. The last chapter of Ecce Homo, entitled \"Why I Am a Destiny\"\
  , is primarily concerned with reiterating Nietzsche's thoughts on Christianity,\
  \ corroborating Christianity's decadence and his ideas as to uncovering Christian\
  \ morality.\nHe signs the book \"Dionysus versus the Crucified.\"\n From Wikipedia\
